# QB Statistics Task

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

This project was made using Electron. Clone the repository, then `cd` into the newly made directory and run `npm install`. Open one terminal and navigate to the project directory and run `npm start`. Open a separate terminal but in the same project directory and run `./node_modules/.bin/electron .` if using a Linux based machine, or `.\node_modules\.bin\electron .` if
using a Windows based machine ( this is to avoid installing Electron globally).
