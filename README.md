# QB Statistics Task

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.28.3.

This project was made using Electron. Clone the repository and `npm install`. Open one terminal and navigate to the project directory and run `npm start`. Open a
separate terminal but for the same project directory, then run `./node_modules/.bin/electron .` to avoid installing Electron globally.

## Further help
